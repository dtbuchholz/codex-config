  Autonomous development loop with fresh context per iteration. Uses an external bash loop that
  spawns fresh Codex sessions, storing state in files to prevent context drift. Based on the

# Ralph Loop

An autonomous development loop for Codex CLI. The key insight: **fresh context per iteration** with
**file I/O as state**.

## Core Principles

### 1. Fresh Context Per Iteration

Each iteration spawns a **new Codex session**. No transcript accumulation.

```
Iteration 1: codex exec - < task.md → works → exits
Iteration 2: codex exec - < task.md → sees files from iter 1 → works → exits
Iteration 3: codex exec - < task.md → sees files from iter 1+2 → works → exits
```

### 2. File I/O as State

All state lives in `.ralph/`:

- `spec.md` - The task specification (re-read each iteration)
- `state.json` - Iteration count, attempts, status
- `progress.log` - Append-only progress tracking
- `evidence/` - Proof of work (iteration outputs, test results)

### 3. Re-Anchoring Every Iteration

Before each iteration, Codex re-reads:

- The original task specification
- Current git state
- Test results from previous iteration
- Evidence of completed work

This prevents drift and ensures the model stays grounded in reality.

### 4. Failure Handling

- Track attempts per task
- Auto-block after N failures with a reason file
- Failed iterations don't pollute future context

## Directory Structure

```
.ralph/
├── spec.md              # Task specification (user-provided)
├── state.json           # Loop state (iteration, attempts, status)
├── progress.log         # Append-only execution log
├── evidence/            # Proof of work
│   ├── iter-001.log     # Raw output from iteration 1
│   ├── iter-002.log     # Raw output from iteration 2
│   └── ...
└── blocked.md           # If task gets stuck (reason + suggestions)
```

## Commands

### /ralph-init - Initialize a Loop

```bash
# Create spec file and initialize state
/ralph-init "Build a REST API with CRUD operations. Tests must pass."

# With options
/ralph-init "TASK_SPEC" --max-iterations 50 --promise "COMPLETE"
```

Runs: `~/.codex/skills/ralph-loop/scripts/ralph-init.sh`

Creates `.ralph/` directory with:

- `spec.md` - Your task specification
- `state.json` - Loop state tracking
- `progress.log` - Append-only progress log
- `evidence/` - Iteration output logs

### /ralph-status - Check Loop Status

Check the current state of the Ralph loop:

```bash
/ralph-status
```

Shows:

- Current state from `state.json`
- Recent progress log entries
- Evidence files

**Interpreting status:**

- `status: pending` - Loop hasn't started or is paused
- `status: completed` - Task finished successfully
- `status: max_iterations` - Stopped after hitting iteration limit
- `status: blocked` - Task blocked after too many failed attempts

### /ralph-cancel - Cancel Loop

Cancel and clean up the current Ralph loop:

```bash
/ralph-cancel
```

To cancel:

1. **Stop the running loop** (if active): Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running `ralph.sh`
2. **Remove the state directory**: `rm -rf .ralph/`

To pause without deleting: just press Ctrl+C. The loop will resume from where it left off when you
run `ralph.sh` again.

## Running the Loop

After initialization, run the loop from your terminal:

```bash
~/.codex/skills/ralph-loop/scripts/ralph.sh
```

Options:

- `--max-iterations N` - Override max iterations
- `--timeout SECONDS` - Timeout per iteration (default: 1800)
- `--verbose` - More detailed output

### Monitor Progress

```bash
# Watch progress
tail -f .ralph/progress.log

# Check state
cat .ralph/state.json | jq .

# View latest output
cat .ralph/evidence/iter-*.log | tail -50
```

### Stop the Loop

The loop stops when:

1. Codex outputs `<promise>DONE</promise>` (completion)
2. Max iterations reached (default: 25)
3. Max attempts per task exceeded (default: 5)
4. You press Ctrl+C

## Configuration

Environment variables:

- `RALPH_MAX_ITERATIONS` - Max loop iterations (default: 25)
- `RALPH_MAX_ATTEMPTS` - Attempts before blocking (default: 5)
- `RALPH_TIMEOUT` - Seconds per iteration (default: 1800)
- `RALPH_PROMISE` - Completion promise text (default: DONE)
- `RALPH_MODEL` - Codex model to use

## When to Use

**Good for:**

- Well-defined tasks with testable success criteria
- Tasks requiring iteration (get tests to pass)
- Overnight/unattended runs
- Tasks with automatic verification

**Not good for:**

- Tasks requiring human judgment
- Unclear success criteria
- Interactive exploration
