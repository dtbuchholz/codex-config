  Review and challenge a plan before implementation. Interactive, opinionated review with scope
  challenge, architecture/code quality/tests/performance passes, and failure mode analysis. Use when
  the user asks to review a plan, challenge a plan, or says "/plan-review".

# Plan Review

Review a plan thoroughly before implementation. For every issue, explain concrete tradeoffs, give an
opinionated recommendation, and ask for input before assuming a direction.

## Finding the Plan

If the user doesn't specify a plan file:

1. Check Codex CLI's plan mode location:
   ```bash
   ls -lt ~/.codex/plans/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -5
   ```
2. Check local plans:
   ```bash
   ls -la plans/ 2>/dev/null || ls -la *.md 2>/dev/null
   ```
3. If multiple found, ask which one. If none found, ask for the path.

## Priority Hierarchy

If running low on context or the user asks to compress: Step 0 > Test diagram > Opinionated
recommendations > Everything else. Never skip Step 0 or the test diagram.

## Step 0: Scope Challenge

Before reviewing anything, answer:

1. **What existing code already solves each sub-problem?** Can we reuse existing flows instead of
   building parallel ones?
2. **What is the minimum set of changes that achieves the goal?** Flag anything that could be
   deferred. Be ruthless about scope creep.
3. **Complexity check:** If the plan touches more than 8 files or introduces more than 2 new
   classes/services, challenge whether the same goal can be achieved with fewer moving parts.

Then ask the user to pick a review mode:

1. **SCOPE REDUCTION** — The plan is overbuilt. Propose a minimal version, then review that.
2. **FULL REVIEW** — Work through interactively, one section at a time (Architecture → Code Quality
   → Tests → Performance) with at most 4 top issues per section.
3. **QUICK REVIEW** — Compressed single pass. Pick the single most important issue per section.
   Present as one numbered list, mandatory test diagram, completion summary. One AskUserQuestion
   round at the end.

**If the user does not pick SCOPE REDUCTION, respect that fully.** Your job becomes making their
chosen plan succeed. Raise scope concerns once in Step 0 — after that, commit to their scope and
optimize within it.

## Review Sections

Work through each section in order. After each section, you MUST call AskUserQuestion with your
findings. Do NOT proceed to the next section until the user responds.

### 1. Architecture Review

Evaluate:

- System design and component boundaries
- Dependency graph and coupling
- Data flow patterns and bottlenecks
- Security architecture (auth, data access, API boundaries)
- For each new codepath or integration point, describe one realistic production failure scenario and
  whether the plan accounts for it

Use ASCII diagrams for any non-trivial data flow, state machine, or processing pipeline.

**STOP.** Call AskUserQuestion with findings before proceeding.

### 2. Code Quality Review

Evaluate:

- Code organization and module structure
- DRY violations — flag repetition aggressively
- Error handling patterns and missing edge cases
- Over-engineering vs under-engineering
- Whether existing ASCII diagrams in touched files are still accurate after this change

**STOP.** Call AskUserQuestion with findings before proceeding.

### 3. Test Review

Build a diagram of all new codepaths, data flows, and branching outcomes. For each item in the
diagram, verify a test exists. Flag gaps.

**STOP.** Call AskUserQuestion with findings before proceeding.

### 4. Performance Review

Evaluate:

- N+1 queries and database access patterns
- Memory usage concerns
- Caching opportunities
- Slow or high-complexity code paths

**STOP.** Call AskUserQuestion with findings before proceeding.

## How to Present Issues

For every issue (bug, smell, design concern, risk):

- Describe the problem concretely, with file and line references
- Present 2–3 options, including "do nothing" where reasonable
- For each option, state in one line: effort, risk, and maintenance burden
- **Lead with your recommendation.** "Do B. Here's why:" — not "Option B might be worth
  considering." Be opinionated.
- Number issues (1, 2, 3...) and letter options (A, B, C...)
- In AskUserQuestion, start with "Recommend [LETTER]: [one-line reason]" then list all options
- Keep each option to one sentence max

## Required Outputs

### "What Already Exists" section

List existing code/flows that already partially solve sub-problems, and whether the plan reuses them
or unnecessarily rebuilds them.

### "NOT in Scope" section

List work that was considered and explicitly deferred, with a one-line rationale per item.

### Failure Modes

For each new codepath in the test diagram, list one realistic failure (timeout, nil reference, race
condition, stale data, etc.) and whether:

1. A test covers that failure
2. Error handling exists for it
3. The user would see a clear error or a silent failure

If any failure mode has no test AND no error handling AND would be silent, flag it as a **critical
gap**.

### Deferred Work

Any genuinely valuable deferred work gets captured with:

- **What:** One-line description
- **Why:** The concrete problem it solves
- **Context:** Enough detail to pick this up in 3 months without re-deriving it

Ask the user which deferred items they want captured before writing them.

### Completion Summary

At the end, display:

```
Step 0: Scope Challenge (user chose: ___)
Architecture Review: ___ issues found
Code Quality Review: ___ issues found
Test Review: diagram produced, ___ gaps identified
Performance Review: ___ issues found
NOT in scope: written
What already exists: written
Deferred work: ___ items proposed
Failure modes: ___ critical gaps flagged
Unresolved decisions: ___ (list any skipped AskUserQuestion rounds)
```

## Rules

- Never write code during this skill. Only review and challenge the plan.
- If the user skips an AskUserQuestion or interrupts to move on, note which decisions were left
  unresolved. List these at the end as "Unresolved decisions that may bite you later."
- Check git log for this branch. If prior commits suggest a previous review cycle, be more
  aggressive reviewing areas that were previously problematic.
- When the user chose FULL REVIEW or QUICK REVIEW, do not continue lobbying for scope reduction.
  Make their plan succeed.
