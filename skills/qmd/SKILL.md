  to recall past decisions, find relevant context, or search their knowledge base. Requires QMD

# QMD

Search your indexed knowledge base using QMD (semantic + keyword search). Surfaces relevant context
from project memory files, skill definitions, documentation, and past conversation transcripts.

## When This Skill Applies

- User explicitly says "/qmd"
- User asks "what do I know about X?" or "have I dealt with X before?"
- User wants to find past decisions, patterns, or context across projects

## Prerequisites

QMD must be installed. Check availability before running any search:

```bash
~/.codex/scripts/qmd.sh status        # Check index health
~/.codex/scripts/qmd.sh mcp --http    # Start daemon if not running
```

If the wrapper exits with code 127 ("No working qmd binary found"), QMD is not installed on this
machine. **Do not attempt to search** — tell the user QMD is not available and fall back to standard
tools (Grep, Glob, Read) instead.

## Search Modes

### 1. Quick Search (keyword, fastest)

For exact terms, function names, error messages, or known phrases:

```bash
~/.codex/scripts/qmd.sh search "pre-commit hook gitleaks" -n 5
```

### 2. Semantic Search (vector similarity)

For conceptual queries where exact words may differ:

```bash
~/.codex/scripts/qmd.sh vsearch "how to handle database migrations safely" -n 5
```

### 3. Deep Search (hybrid + reranking, best quality)

For open-ended questions combining keyword and semantic understanding:

```bash
~/.codex/scripts/qmd.sh query "authentication patterns across projects" -n 5
```

### 4. Temporal Recall (date-scoped conversations)

For questions about what happened on a specific day. Resolves natural language dates and searches
conversation transcripts:

```bash
~/.codex/scripts/qmd-temporal-recall.py "last Tuesday" "what did I do?" --source both --top 5
```

Accepts: `YYYY-MM-DD`, `today`, `yesterday`, `last Monday`, etc. Use `--source claude`,
`--source codex`, or `--source both`.

## Execution

### Step 1: Understand the Query

Determine which search mode fits:

| Query type       | Mode              | Example                              |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Exact term/error | `search`          | "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "exit code 126" |
| Conceptual       | `vsearch`         | "how do I handle retries"            |
| Open-ended       | `query`           | "what testing patterns do I use"     |
| Date-scoped      | `temporal-recall` | "what did I do last Tuesday"         |

If unsure, default to `query` (deep search). For questions about specific days, use temporal recall.

### Step 2: Search

Run the appropriate command. Use `--json` for structured output when you need to process results
programmatically, or `--md` for readable output:

```bash
~/.codex/scripts/qmd.sh query "the user's question" -n 6 --md
```

To restrict to a specific collection:

```bash
~/.codex/scripts/qmd.sh query "deployment setup" -n 6 --md -c codex-memory
```

Available collections:

| Collection             | Contains                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `codex-memory`         | Project-specific memory files (learnings, bugs, architecture) |
| `codex-skills`         | Skill definitions and reference docs                          |
| `codex-config`         | CODEX.md and README                                           |
| `codex-conversations`  | Cleaned Codex conversation transcripts                        |
| `claude-conversations` | Cleaned Claude conversation transcripts                       |

### Step 3: Read Relevant Files

If search results point to a file that needs more context, read it:

```bash
~/.codex/scripts/qmd.sh get "codex-memory/path/to/MEMORY.md"
```

Or use the file path directly with the Read tool for full content.

### Step 4: Synthesize

Present findings to the user:

1. **Direct answer** — what the search found
2. **Sources** — which files/collections the information came from
3. **Gaps** — if the search didn't find what was expected, note it

## Rules

- Always cite the source file when presenting information from search results
- If QMD daemon is not running, start it or fall back to `~/.codex/scripts/qmd.sh search` (slower)
- Do not modify any files during this skill — it is read-only
- If no results found, say so clearly rather than guessing
- For broad queries, search multiple collections or omit the `-c` flag
