# QMD

Search your indexed knowledge base using QMD (semantic + keyword search). Surfaces relevant context
from memory files, skill definitions, and configuration docs.

## When This Skill Applies

- User explicitly says "/qmd"
- User asks "what do I know about X?" or "have I dealt with X before?"
- User wants to find past decisions, patterns, or context across tools/projects

## Prerequisites

QMD must be installed and the daemon running:

```bash
qmd status        # Check index health
qmd mcp --http    # Start daemon if not running
```

## Search Modes

### 1. Quick Search (keyword, fastest)

For exact terms, function names, error messages, or known phrases:

```bash
qmd search "pre-commit hook gitleaks" -n 5
```

### 2. Semantic Search (vector similarity)

For conceptual queries where exact words may differ:

```bash
qmd vsearch "how to handle database migrations safely" -n 5
```

### 3. Deep Search (hybrid + reranking, best quality)

For open-ended questions combining keyword and semantic understanding:

```bash
qmd query "authentication patterns across projects" -n 5
```

## Execution

### Step 1: Understand the Query

Determine which search mode fits:

| Query type       | Mode      | Example                           |
| ---------------- | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| Exact term/error | `search`  | "OPENAI_API_KEY", "exit code 126" |
| Conceptual       | `vsearch` | "how do I handle retries"         |
| Open-ended       | `query`   | "what testing patterns do I use"  |

If unsure, default to `query`.

### Step 2: Search

Run the appropriate command. Use `--json` when processing results programmatically, or `--md` for
readable output:

```bash
qmd query "the user's question" -n 6 --md
```

To restrict to a specific collection:

```bash
qmd query "deployment setup" -n 6 --md -c codex-skills
```

Common collections:

| Collection     | Contains                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `codex-memory` | Memory files and rollups                   |
| `codex-skills` | Skill definitions and references           |
| `codex-config` | CODEX.md, README, templates, Makefile      |
| `claude-*`     | Optional Claude collections for cross-tool |

### Step 3: Read Relevant Files

If results point to a file that needs more context:

```bash
qmd get "codex-skills/path/to/SKILL.md"
```

Or open the file path directly.

### Step 4: Synthesize

Present findings to the user:

1. Direct answer
2. Sources (collection + file)
3. Gaps (what wasn't found)

## Rules

- Always cite source files when presenting search results
- If daemon is not running, start it or fall back to stdio usage
- This skill is read-only; do not modify files during search
- If no results are found, say so clearly rather than guessing
